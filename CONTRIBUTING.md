## Contributing

We welcome most contributions. While it is our goal to allow everyone to contribute, contributions not meeting the project's standards may be rejected. If this happens to you, don't fret. We usually provide reasons for rejection to give you the opportunity to correct anything out of place. Consider asking first before attempting to make sweeping changes.

First fork the HandBrake repository using GitHub's web interface, and clone the fork to your local machine (`git clone my-fork`). Then create and switch to an appropriately named local branch to track your changes (`git checkout master; git checkout -b branch-name`). This allows you to make as many changes as you like without affecting the `master` branch, and helps identify groups of changes when submitting pull requests later on.

To make a change, edit the appropriate file(s), commit them to your local branch (`git add changed-files; git commit`), and push the branch to your fork on GitHub (`git push my-fork branch-name`). You're now ready to open a pull request using GitHub's web interface.
